# FakeNewsVacinas

The project FakeNewsVacinas focuses on detecting misinformation related to COVID vaccines using Python and NTLTK. It leverages machine learning techniques to classify tweets as either fake or real. The repository includes Python scripts, dependencies listed in a requirements.txt file, and instructions for setting up the environment using Anaconda. The project aims to analyze and filter vaccine-related content, potentially using NLP models for text classification.
